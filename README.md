### Introduction
This page is created to help you to create your own Hearrate sensor project. In orderto fix the problem of drinking and driving, my partner (Mohita Prabhakar) and I (Karandeep Singh) chose Alcohol Gas sensor and Pulse sensor respectively.Instead of people thinking they're okay to drive with alcohol in their body, they can use our projectto see if there is a great amount of alcohol in their body along with seeing their heart rate. It's a cheap alternative, and isn't too hard to make yourself.

Using a gas and a heartbeat sensor, users can plug those into a PCB and use a raspberry pi to display the readings on either a computer or phone when the app is ready and completed.

### Bill of Materials

Given below are parts and material required for this project. Most of these
parts are pretty cheap which makes this project not that expensive, but that is
because I already had a raspberry pi, electronic parts kit, and the PCB kit was
paid for as a part of our tuition. 

| **Item**                   | **Quantity** | **Cost**  | **Supplier & Part Number**        |
|----------------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit | 1            | \$79.99  | (Canakit) Amazon - B01CCF9BYG     |
| XD-58C Sensor              | 1            | \$18.99   | (JutaTech) Amazon.ca - B01AUVMFIS |
| Electronics Parts Kit      | 1            | \$119.99  | Humber - SKU \#163                |
| Jumper Wires (120 pack)    | 1            | \$19.99   | (Elegoo) Amazon.ca - B01EV70C78   |
| Solder Kit                 | 1            | \~\$40.00 | Humber                            |
| Soldering Iron             | 1            | \~\$20.00 | Humber                            |
| Power Cables/Connectors    | 1            | included  | Humber/Amazon                     |

Again, these are just the parts and prices for the things we bought. Prices may
change over time, but our total comes to around \$300.

### Introduction
This page is created to help you to create your own Hearrate sensor project. In order
to fix the problem of drinking and driving, my partner (Mohita Prabhakar) and I 
(Karandeep Singh) chose Alcohol Gas sensor and Pulse sensor respectively.Instead of 
people thinking they're okay to drive with alcohol in their body, they can use our project
to see if there is a great amount of alcohol in their body along with seeing their heart rate.
It's a cheap alternative, and isn't too hard to make yourself.

Using a gas and a heartbeat sensor, users can plug those into a PCB and use a raspberry pi to display the readings on either a computer or phone when the app is ready and completed!

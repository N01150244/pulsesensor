# Pulsesensor
## Pulse rate sensor for breathalyzer
# Week 12
The last thing I did was to write a set of build instructions so that other people can <br>
follow those to make their own projects. I wrote the build instructions in README.md file<br>
- [Build Instructions](https://github.com/N01150244/pulsesensor/blob/master/README.md)
# Week 11
In this week I have prepared a presentation on the work I have done in this semester <br>
to complete my project. I will be presenting this presentation next week. Along with this <br>
presentation I have to demonstrate my sensor to my classmates.<br>

# Week 10 
Before this week I took help from Professor Anthony to print a 3D case for my sensor.<br>
I wrote a Progress Rport in which I mentioned all work that is done till now with respect<br>
to the schedule. I mentioned the things which I got to learn while making this project and<br>
gave a synopsis about the budget.The python script which I wrote for my sensor is given below.<br>
The script reads and shows normal and abnormal heartbeats.<br>

# Week 9
We created a 30 second video this week. In my video I have a 2 second introduction, <br>
show what parts have arrived, a short video on the blink test on the PCB and Raspberry Pi<br>
bootup. Lastly I also show the working of Heartrate sensor booting up with the pi, following <br>
with what I plan to achieve.<br>

# Week 8
This week we had to create and upload a placard for our project. After looking at the <br>
specifications for the sensors that we will be using we have a better understanding of <br>
what we will need to be using, power, and design of our project.<br>
Along with this I wrote my 30-second script.<br>

# Week 7
This week we had to have our PCB working and successfully booted up. <br>
There was a problem with my memory card at first with my Raspberry Pi, but<br>
after installing the latest version of Raspbian,everything was working fine.<br>
<br>
Due to some circuit problem in my PCB board, I had to change some connections<br>
so I took help from our prototype lab. We were provided with new python script<br>
BME280.py to run the temperature, humidity and light sensor.<br>
<br>
Once booted it the sensors should be plugged in and working after running a<br> 
program on the Raspberry Pi. All my sensors were successfully working, and my <br>
LED also flashed.<br>
<br>
I ran the "i2cdetect -y 1" command, it showed the sensors being recognized.<br>
<br>

# Week 6
By this week I updated my progress report that states all the things we have <br>
gone through from week 1 until now(which is seen below) and I also just recently <br>
completed soldering my PCB board and will go onto testing it.<br>
<br>
## PCB Soldered:

# During Strike:
During this time-period I recieved my parts that I had ordered.
# Week 5
By this week we had to have ordered our parts needed for this project. All the parts <br>
that are still on their way need to at least have their proof of purchase.<br>

## Proof of purchase for Heartbeat Sensor:

# Week 4
By this week we needed to hand in our Budget Report in exchange to get our GANTT chart back.<br>
-   [Budget Report](https://github.com/N01150244/pulsesensor/blob/master/BudgetKarandeepSingh.xlsx)
# Week 3
By this week we needed to hand in our GANTT chart, and get back our proposal.<br>
-   [GANTT chart/Project Plan](https://github.com/N01150244/pulsesensor/blob/master/KarandeepSingh(n01150244).mp)

# Week 2
We got our quiz back and we handed in the proposal.<br>
-   [Proposal for Heartrate Sensor](https://github.com/N01150244/pulsesensor/blob/master/ProposalContentKarandeepSinghRev02.docx)
# Week 1
In week one we did a tech quiz and decided on different sensors related to our software application.
